Hi, I’m Qingwan (I also go by Cecelia)! I’m currently a Data Analyst at Dell Technologies. My work focuses on automating reporting and turning data into insights using tools like Power BI and Jira. One of the projects I’m proudest of is redesigning a manual reporting process into a fully automated, 20+ page Power BI dashboard. I integrated Jira APIs, mapped complex data, defined key KPIs, and built intuitive visualizations based on user feedback - making it easier for our team to track performance, spot trends, and make confident decisions. I’ve also built and optimized 15+ Jira dashboards for agile engineering teams to better manage sprint progress, visualize ticket flows, and reduce admin work. These tools help teams plan more effectively and stay focused on what matters most. Outside of my analyst role, I co-lead Employee Resource Groups like the GenNext NE Grad Programming Pillar and Asians in Action. I help organize cultural events and plan sessions that guide employees through their graduate school journeys - all part of building a workplace culture that’s inclusive, curious, and growth-oriented.

I graduated from Boston College in 2023 with a B.A. in Applied Psychology and Computer Science, along with a minor in Cyberstrategy and Design. 
I was honored to receive the General Excellence Award for my academic and community contributions.

Outside of work, I serve as the Program Manager at Aftermath Learning Lab, where I lead a team of undergraduate researchers in writing academic papers, applying for grants, and organizing conferences. I also design and facilitate workshops that integrate design thinking and generative models with educational game development to promote sustainability and systems thinking. So far, I’ve developed engaging learning experiences for over 100 college and high school students. I’m especially passionate about using design thinking and generative models to create meaningful, playful educational tools that empower young people to imagine and build a better future.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
